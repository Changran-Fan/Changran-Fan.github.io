I'm an Assistant Professor at College of Business, Leiwis University. I received my PhD in Information Systems and Technology Management from the University of Pittsburgh in 2024.

My research interests lie at the confluence of emerging technologies, firm-level and societal-level shocks, and the ensuing digital transformation. I examine the effects of technology adoption by studying the operational configurations in which the technologies are deployed and model the resulting business value calculus using econometric and machine learning methods.
